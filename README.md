# Summary of changes to HTML file in DevTools after compression

# Summary of removing 'server' header
After first trying the common mod_headers approach (Header always set Server "CSE135 Server") and not getting consistent results, we switched to ModSecurity. We enabled security2 and set SecServerSignature "CSE135 Server", loading the directive via Apacheâ€™s main configuration (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf). After reloading Apache and clearing the browser cache (older responses had cached headers), DevTools confirmed the Server header now reads CSE135 Server

# Compression Setup
Enabled Gzip compression via mod_deflate (Apache). Verified that HTML, CSS, and JS are now being sent compressed to reduce file size. After enabling, Chrome DevTools showed `content-encoding: gzip` for HTML files, indicating successful compression. This reduces transfer size, improving page load time.
